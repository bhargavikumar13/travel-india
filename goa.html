The name ‘Dudhsagar’ literally translates to ‘sea of milk’ which many believe is an allusion to the white spray and foam that the great waterfall creates as it cascades into the waters of the lake. The falls are at their zenith during the monsoon season, although they are a popular attraction all year round.</div>

			<div class="righttext">The Saturday Night Market is located at Arpora in North Goa, 4.3 kilometers from Anjuna beach, and 3.7 kilometers from the Baga beach. The market is 17.7 kilometers north of Panaji. Also called Ingo’s Night Market, it is open between 4 PM and 11 PM from November to April. This is a great place not just for shopping, but also for feeling the Goa ambience. There are party zones for revelers. There is live music, bars, and restaurants serving organic salads, chocolate waffles, Greek food, and local delicacies. You can shop clothes, bags, spices, funky jewelry, handicrafts, leather accessories, shoes, exotic lamps, and more.
The night market at Arpora attracts a huge number of tourists – both Europeans and Indians. It is particularly popular with foreign tourists, and the hippie culture. You will find many stalls run by Europeans, making the ambience distinctively cosmopolitan. The nearby Mackies Saturday Night Bazaar beside the Baga River is much smaller in size and has less character.</div>
