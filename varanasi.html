According to the Puranas the oldest name of Chunar was Charanadri as Lord Vishnu had taken his first step in his Vaman incarnation in the dynasty of Great king Bali. However Chunar came into prominence after the visit of Babar followed by Shershah Suri, Humayun, Akbar, Aurangzeb and finally the Britishers. 

It is said that Maharaja Vikramaditya, the king of Ujjain established the fort of Chunar. According to the Alha Khand, King Sahadeo made this fort as his capital and established the statue of Naina Yogini in a cave of Vindhya hill. To commemorate his victory on 52 rulers, King Sahadeo built a stone umbrella inside the fort.

			<div class="lefttext">The Alamgir Mosque enjoys an enviable location. Flanked by the sacred River Ganges, it overlooks the Panchganga Ghat. The masjid manifests impressive architectural skills. It is a fine example of what can be achieved if Hindu and Mughal styles of architecture are beautifully blended. The Hindu effect is more noticeable in the lower portions of the mosque and the enclosure walls whereas in the rest of the mosque the Muslim effect is far more conspicuous.
When you are out on a sight seeing trip to visit the various Tourist Attractions in Varanasi, make sure that the Alamgir Mosque is included.
